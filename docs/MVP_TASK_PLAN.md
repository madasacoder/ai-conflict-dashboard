# AI Conflict Dashboard - MVP Task Plan

## Project Vision
The AI Conflict Dashboard transparently orchestrates multiple AI models, providing clear insights, consensus, and explicit conflict resolution, enabling informed editing decisions.

## MVP Scope
Create a functional dashboard that:
1. Accepts user text input for AI analysis
2. Sends requests to multiple AI models
3. Analyzes responses for consensus, conflicts, and unique insights
4. Displays results in three organized lanes
5. Allows users to select/apply suggestions
