# AI Conflict Dashboard - Pragmatic Small Steps Plan

## Core Philosophy: Fix What's Broken, Test What Works

Based on our current state:
- âœ… Working web app (Phase 2 complete)
- ðŸŸ¡ Desktop app (40% complete)
- ðŸŸ¡ Web workflow builder (created but has errors)

## Immediate Priority: Fix Current Issues (Week 1)

### Task 0.1: Fix Web App Workflow Builder
**Time**: 4 hours
**Why**: We already built it, just needs debugging

**Steps**:
1. Check browser console for specific errors
2. Fix JavaScript loading issues
3. Test with minimal features first
4. Add one feature at a time

**Tests**:
- Manual testing first
- Basic smoke tests
- Then automated tests

### Task 0.2: Fix Ollama Integration
**Time**: 2 hours  
**Why**: User has Ollama running but gets errors

**Steps**:
1. Debug /api/ollama/models endpoint
2. Test Ollama connection
3. Fix error display
4. Add proper error messages

**Tests**:
- Integration test with real Ollama
- Error handling tests

### Task 0.3: Complete Desktop App Drag-and-Drop
**Time**: 4 hours
**Why**: Core feature still buggy

**Steps**:
1. Use the click-to-add solution we built
2. Polish the UI
3. Test thoroughly
4. Document known issues

## Phase 1: Stabilize What Exists (Week 2)

### Task 1.1: Comprehensive Error Handling
**Time**: 6 hours
**Why**: Both apps need better error messages

**Deliverables**:
1. Error boundary for web workflow builder
2. User-friendly error messages
3. Fallback behaviors
4. Error logging

**Tests**:
- Error simulation tests
- Recovery flow tests

### Task 1.2: Test Critical Paths
**Time**: 8 hours
**Why**: Ensure core features don't break

**Focus Areas**:
1. Web app: Multi-model analysis flow
2. Web app: File upload
3. Desktop app: Workflow creation
4. API: Key endpoints

**Approach**:
- Integration tests over unit tests
- Test real user workflows
- Performance benchmarks

---

## Phase 2: Complete Desktop MVP (Week 3-4)

### Task 2.1: Desktop Workflow Execution
**Time**: 8 hours
**Why**: Already have backend, need to connect

**Steps**:
1. Connect to workflow_engine.py
2. Add progress indicators
3. Display results
4. Handle errors gracefully

### Task 2.2: Desktop Polish
**Time**: 12 hours
**Why**: First impressions matter

**Focus**:
1. Smooth animations
2. Consistent styling
3. Keyboard shortcuts
4. Auto-save
5. Undo/redo

---

## Phase 3: Testing & Documentation (Week 5)

### Task 3.1: End-to-End Testing
**Time**: 12 hours
**Why**: Ensure everything works together

**Coverage**:
1. Complete user journeys
2. Cross-platform testing
3. Performance testing
4. Security testing

### Task 3.2: User Documentation
**Time**: 8 hours
**Why**: Reduce support burden

**Deliverables**:
1. Getting started guide
2. Feature tutorials
3. Troubleshooting guide
4. API documentation

---

## Key Differences from Original Plan

1. **Start from current state**, not from scratch
2. **Fix bugs first**, then add features
3. **Manual testing acceptable** for quick fixes
4. **Pragmatic coverage** - test critical paths, not everything
5. **Shorter timeline** - 5 weeks vs 3+ weeks just for foundation

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Web workflow builder works without errors
- [ ] Ollama integration functional
- [ ] Desktop app drag-and-drop reliable
- [ ] 80% test coverage on critical paths
- [ ] <5 second load time
- [ ] Zero uncaught errors
- [ ] User can complete full workflow without help

## Testing Strategy

### Immediate (Manual Testing OK):
- Click through all features
- Try edge cases
- Check error messages

### Short-term (Basic Automation):
- Smoke tests for deployments
- Integration tests for APIs
- UI tests for critical paths

### Long-term (Comprehensive):
- Unit tests for utilities
- Performance benchmarks
- Security scanning
- Cross-browser testing

This revised plan acknowledges where we are and focuses on shipping a working product rather than perfect code.
