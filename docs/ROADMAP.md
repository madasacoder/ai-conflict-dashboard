# AI Conflict Dashboard - Master Development Roadmap

## Core Concept
Multiple LLMs reviewing each other's work produces better results than any single model.

## Development Philosophy
**Document like you're building for 1000 users, but build like you're serving 1 user (yourself).**

---

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 0: Proof of Concept (MVP STOPS HERE)
**Timeline**: 1 week  
**Goal**: Validate the core idea works  
**Investment**: Minimal ($50 in API costs)

#### Core Features:
- Basic FastAPI server
- Call 2-3 LLMs with same prompt
- Display results side-by-side
- Simple HTML/JS frontend
- Local storage for API keys

**Success Criteria**: 
- ✓ You use it instead of copy-pasting between ChatGPT/Claude
- ✓ It saves you time
- ✓ The comparisons provide value

**Decision Point**: If you don't use it daily → STOP. Pivot or abandon.

### 🔄 Phase 1: Usable Product (IF PoC WORKS)
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks  
**Goal**: Others can use it without help  
**Investment**: ~100 hours development

#### New Features:
- Proper React component structure
- Error handling & retry logic
- Loading states & progress indicators
- File upload support (.txt, .md, .py, etc.)
- Basic diff highlighting
- Configuration UI for API keys
- Export results feature

**Success Criteria**: 
- ✓ 5 people use it without documentation
- ✓ Users report time savings
- ✓ Feature requests start coming in

**Decision Point**: If <5 users adopt it → STOP. Analyze why.

### 🌐 Phase 4: Platform Vision (IF PRODUCT-MARKET FIT)
**Timeline**: 1+ years  
**Goal**: Become the standard for AI comparison  
**Investment**: Series A funding

#### Platform Features:

## Key Principles

### 1. Progressive Validation
Each phase must prove value before proceeding to the next.

### 2. User-Driven Development
Features are added based on actual usage, not speculation.

### 3. Technical Debt Management
- Phase 0: Quick & dirty is fine
- Phase 1: Clean up the critical paths
- Phase 2: Professional standards
- Phase 3+: Enterprise grade

### 4. Focus Boundaries
- Phase 0: Just make it work
- Phase 1: Make it usable
- Phase 2: Make it reliable
- Phase 3: Make it profitable
- Phase 4: Make it dominant

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Costs**: Start with user-provided keys
- **Rate Limits**: Implement queuing early
- **Model Changes**: Abstract provider interfaces

### Business Risks
- **No Users**: Keep Phase 0 minimal
- **No Revenue**: Don't build Phase 3 without payment validation
- **Competition**: Focus on multi-model comparison USP

### Personal Risks
- **Burnout**: Hard stops at each phase
- **Scope Creep**: Document ideas, don't build them
- **Perfectionism**: "Good enough" for current phase

## Success Metrics by Phase

| Phase | Users | Response Time | Uptime | Revenue | Time Investment |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| 0 | 1 (you) | <10s | N/A | $0 | 1 week |
| 1 | 5-10 | <5s | 95% | $0 | 3 weeks |
| 2 | 100+ | <2s | 99.9% | Willing to pay | 2 months |
| 3 | 500+ | <1s | 99.99% | $10K+ MRR | 6 months |
| 4 | 5000+ | <500ms | 99.999% | $100K+ MRR | Ongoing |

## Current Status: Phase 0
**Started**: [Date]  
**Target Completion**: [Date + 1 week]  
**Next Review**: After 1 week of personal use

Remember: It's better to have a working Phase 0 that you use daily than a perfect Phase 3 that never ships.
