## 🚀 Conclusion
Current results reflect honest status: backend ~51% coverage with many tests still failing under stricter scenarios; UI E2E active with majority failing due to layout/selector mismatches. Next steps to Grade A: fix UI E2E blockers (canvas height, selector uniqueness, execute gating, labels) and unblock TS to restore unit/integration coverage.
