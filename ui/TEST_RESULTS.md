# Test Results Summary

## Date: 2025-08-09
## UI/Web App Test Suite Status

### Overall Statistics (latest Playwright run)
- **Total Playwright tests executed**: 56
- **Passing**: 10
- **Failing**: 46
- **Notes**: Many failures are due to UI layout/selector issues (see Known Issues)

### Test Categories

#### Current Passing Highlights
- A subset of E2E checks pass (navigation, some visibility assertions)

### ❌ Failing Areas (Known Issues)
1. Hidden canvas: `.workflow-canvas` height resolves to 0 (inner wrapper lacks height) → drag timeouts
2. Duplicate `.workflow-builder` selectors (outer/inner) → strict selector conflicts
3. Execute button disabled when tests expect validation on click
4. Label mismatches: tests expect “Workflow”/“Create New”; UI uses icon dropdown/“New Workflow”

### Test Stability
- Playwright stability acceptable; failures are deterministic due to layout/selector issues

### Recent Improvements
- Playwright configured with dev server reuse; backend server healthy during runs

### Recommendations
1. Fix UI layout/selector issues (canvas height, unique builder selector, Execute gating, labels)
2. Unblock TypeScript type-check to re-enable Vitest suites
3. Use data-testid consistently in UI for E2E stability

### Test Commands

```bash
# Playwright tests (real browser)
npx playwright install --with-deps
npx playwright test --reporter=line
```

### Conclusion
E2E runs are active; 10 passing, 46 failing. Failures are primarily UI layout/selector mismatches, not backend instability. Addressing those will unlock broader E2E coverage.
