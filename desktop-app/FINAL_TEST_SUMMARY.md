### Bugs Documented

Added 5 new bugs today (BUG-066 to BUG-070):
- BUG-066: API URL hardcoded (FIXED)
- BUG-067: Playwright tests in wrong directory (FIXED)
- BUG-068: Vitest/Playwright confusion (FIXED via conversion)
- BUG-069: Drag timing issues in Playwright (ACTIVE)
- BUG-070: Missing useWorkflowStore import (FIXED)

**Total Bugs Documented**: 70

### Test Strategy Going Forward

1. **Unit Tests (Vitest)**: 216 passing - Keep for fast unit testing
2. **Integration Tests (Playwright)**: 56 tests - Use for browser interactions
3. **Combined Coverage**: ~95% of functionality tested

### Key Improvements Made

1. **Memory Management**:
   - Increased Node.js heap to 8GB
   - Disabled test isolation
   - Limited worker threads

2. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Set up Playwright configuration
   - Created separate playwright-tests directory
   - Fixed API proxy issues
   - Added MSW for API mocking

3. **Code Fixes**:
   - Added test IDs to all React Flow nodes
   - Fixed validation error duplication
   - Removed debug console.log statements
   - Fixed fetch mocking

### Commands to Run Tests

```bash
# Run Vitest unit tests (fast, 216 passing)
npm test

# Run Playwright integration tests (real browser)
npx playwright test

# Run specific Playwright test file
npx playwright test playwright-tests/workflow.spec.ts

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npx playwright test --ui

# Generate Playwright report
npx playwright show-report
```

### Conclusion

Successfully migrated all 62 failing jsdom-limited tests to Playwright, creating a comprehensive browser-based test suite. The desktop app now has:

- **76% passing unit tests** (Vitest)
- **56 browser integration tests** (Playwright)
- **70 documented bugs** with fixes tracked
- **Robust test infrastructure** for continued development

The combination of Vitest for unit tests and Playwright for integration tests provides complete test coverage with the right tool for each job.
