---

## 📋 Phase 1: Eliminate Duplicate Files (Day 1)

### Task 1.1: Remove Backend Pytest Duplication
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes  
**Risk**: Low  

**AI Assistant Prompt**:
```
Delete the file `backend/pytest.ini` as it is 100% redundant with the pytest configuration in `backend/pyproject.toml`. The pyproject.toml already contains all the necessary pytest settings including test paths, coverage configuration, and parallel execution settings. After deletion, verify that all tests still run correctly using `pytest` command from the backend directory.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- `backend/pytest.ini` is deleted
- All tests run successfully with `pytest`
- No pytest-related errors in CI/CD

### Task 1.2: Remove Backend Requirements Duplication
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Estimated Time**: 45 minutes  
**Risk**: Medium  

**AI Assistant Prompt**:
```
Delete the file `backend/requirements.txt` as it is 80% redundant with the dependencies section in `backend/pyproject.toml`. The pyproject.toml contains all necessary dependencies with proper version specifications. After deletion, verify that the project can be installed correctly using `pip install -e .` from the backend directory. Update any documentation or scripts that reference requirements.txt to use pyproject.toml instead.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- `backend/requirements.txt` is deleted
- Project installs successfully with `pip install -e .`
- All import statements work correctly
- Documentation updated to reference pyproject.toml

### Task 1.3: Remove Duplicate Vitest Config
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes  
**Risk**: Low  

**AI Assistant Prompt**:
```
Delete the file `frontend/vitest.config.js` as it is a duplicate of `frontend/vitest.config.ts`. Keep only the TypeScript version (vitest.config.ts) as it provides better type safety and IDE support. After deletion, verify that all tests run correctly using `npm test` from the frontend directory.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- `frontend/vitest.config.js` is deleted
- All tests run successfully with `npm test`
- No vitest configuration errors

### Task 1.4: Remove Desktop App Python Duplicates
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes  
**Risk**: Medium  

**AI Assistant Prompt**:
```
Delete the files `desktop-app/pytest.ini` and `desktop-app/requirements.txt` as they are duplicates of the backend configuration files. The desktop app should reference the backend configuration instead of maintaining separate copies. Update any scripts in `desktop-app/package.json` that reference these files to use the backend versions. Verify that the desktop app backend still works correctly after these changes.
```

**Success Criteria**:
- `desktop-app/pytest.ini` and `desktop-app/requirements.txt` are deleted
- Desktop app scripts updated to reference backend configs
- Desktop app backend functionality works correctly
- No broken references in package.json scripts
