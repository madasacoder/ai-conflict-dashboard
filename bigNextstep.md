## Key Technical Decisions

### Analysis Engine Architecture
The analysis engine uses a "judge LLM" approach:
1. Collect responses from multiple models
2. Synthesize them into a structured prompt
3. Send to a high-quality LLM (GPT-4 or Claude) for analysis
4. Request structured JSON output with consensus, conflicts, and insights
5. Parse and display results with beautiful visualizations

### State Management Strategy
- **Zustand** for all client-side state (simple, TypeScript-friendly)
- **Modular stores**: workflowStore, costStore, uiStore
- **Real-time sync** between UI and backend via WebSocket
- **Persistence**: Important state saved to SQLite

### UI Development Philosophy
- **Polish from the start**: Every component includes all interaction states
- **Design system first**: Build consistent components before features
- **Motion with purpose**: Animations enhance understanding, not distract
- **Perceived performance**: Make it feel faster than it is

### Week 3 Checkpoint (MVP)
- ✅ User can create and run a workflow
- ✅ At least 2 LLM providers working
- ✅ Basic cost tracking visible
- ✅ Results are useful

### Week 5 Checkpoint (Intelligence)

- ✅ New users succeed quickly

### Week 7 Checkpoint (Launch)
- ✅ App starts in <2 seconds
- ✅ Search finds past work

## Final Note

This plan delivers a **focused, valuable tool** that users will actually want to use daily. By removing enterprise complexity, we can deliver in 7 weeks what would have taken 6 months, and the result will be better for our target users.

The key is discipline: resist adding features that don't directly benefit the individual user. Every line of code should answer "yes" to: "Does this make the user's AI work easier, faster, or cheaper?"
