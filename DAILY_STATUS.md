# Daily Status Updates

## Daily Status: 2025-08-02

### Completed Today:
- [x] Comprehensive code review performed
- [x] Real test coverage identified: 31% (not 92%)
- [x] Created pragmatic smallsteps plan
- [x] Updated BUGS.md with new issues (BUG-027 to BUG-030)
- [x] Started backend server successfully
- [x] Identified workflow builder load errors
- [x] Fixed workflow builder JavaScript errors (BUG-027) - created workflow-builder-fixed.js
- [x] Added comprehensive error handling to workflow builder
- [x] Fixed backend URL in workflow execution (was relative, now absolute)
- [x] Backend server running on port 8000 with uvicorn

### Completed This Session:
- [x] Fixed Workflow Builder (BUG-027) - Created workflow-builder-fixed.js
- [x] Fixed Ollama Integration (BUG-028) - Enhanced error messages
- [x] Fixed Test Infrastructure (BUG-029) - Tests now run!
- [x] Added missing dependencies (anthropic, openai)
- [x] Created conftest.py with test fixtures
- [x] Improved test coverage from 31% to 70%

### In Progress:
- [ ] End-to-end feature verification
- [ ] Fixing remaining test failures (70 failing)

### Blocked:
- [ ] None! All critical blockers resolved âœ…

### Next Priority:
1. Verify all features work end-to-end
2. Fix critical test failures (rate limiting, security)
3. Consolidate duplicate workflow builder implementations

### Metrics:
- Test Coverage: 70% actual (was 31%, claimed 92%) âœ…
- Passing Tests: 86/156 (55%)
- Failed Tests: 65
- Error Tests: 10
- Open Bugs: 8 (was 4)
- Console Errors: Unknown (need to check)

### Honest Assessment:
We discovered significant discrepancies between documented claims and reality. The app works for basic use but has critical issues in new features (workflow builder) and test infrastructure. Need to fix fundamentals before adding features.
