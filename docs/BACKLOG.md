## üö´ Explicitly Not Doing (Ever?)

These have been considered and rejected:

- **Blockchain integration** - No clear value add
- **Cryptocurrency payments** - Complexity without benefit  
- **Native desktop apps** - Web is sufficient
- **Custom LLM training** - Not our core competency
- **Social media features** - Dilutes focus

---

## üìä Idea Evaluation Criteria

Before moving any item from backlog to active development:

1. **User Request Count**: How many users asked for it?
2. **Revenue Impact**: Will it help monetization?
3. **Complexity Score**: How hard is it to build?
4. **Maintenance Burden**: How hard is it to maintain?
5. **Strategic Alignment**: Does it fit our vision?

Formula: `Priority = (User Requests √ó Revenue Impact) / (Complexity √ó Maintenance)`

## üéØ How to Use This Document

### When You Have an Idea:
1. Add it to the appropriate section
2. Don't build it yet
3. Let it marinate
4. See if users ask for it

### During Development:
```python
# TODO-P1: Add diff highlighting here
# TODO-P2: Add caching here  
# TODO-P3: Add team features here
```

### When Users Request Features:
"Great idea! I've added it to our backlog. We're currently focused on [current phase] to ensure core functionality is solid."

### Monthly Review:
1. Move validated ideas up
2. Remove invalidated ideas
3. Adjust priorities based on data

Remember: **This document is a feature cemetery where good ideas wait for resurrection through user demand.**
