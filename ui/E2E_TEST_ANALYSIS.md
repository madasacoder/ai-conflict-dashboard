## Failure Patterns

### 1. **Timeout Issues (30s)** - 24 failures
Most failures are due to 30-second timeouts, indicating:
- Elements not appearing in expected time
- Actions not completing
- Workflows not executing

### 2. **Selector Issues** - Estimated 8-10 failures
- Wrong selectors for UI elements
- Elements not visible when expected
- Strict mode violations

### 3. **Workflow Execution** - All execution tests failing
- API integration issues
- Missing workflow execution engine
- Backend connection problems

### 4. **Node Interactions** - Most interaction tests failing  
- Node connections not working
- Copy/paste not implemented
- Delete functionality issues

## Key Insights

### What's Working Well ✅
1. **Basic UI Loading** - App loads, builder visible
2. **Drag-Drop** - Our fixed drag-drop tests work perfectly
3. **Storage** - LocalStorage save/load working
4. **Export/Import** - JSON workflow handling works
5. **Canvas Rendering** - React Flow canvas renders properly

### What Needs Fixing ❌
1. **Workflow Execution** - Core execution engine not working
2. **Node Connections** - Can't connect nodes with edges
3. **Ollama Integration** - Most Ollama features not working
4. **MVP Features** - Critical user workflows all failing
5. **Complex Interactions** - Multi-step operations timing out

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Fix Timeouts
- Increase timeout for complex operations
- Add proper wait conditions
- Fix element selectors

### Priority 2: Fix Node Connections
- Implement edge creation between nodes
- Fix connection handles
- Add connection validation

### Priority 3: Fix Workflow Execution
- Ensure backend is running during tests
- Fix API integration
- Implement execution progress tracking

### Priority 4: Fix MVP Features
- Complete workflow creation flow
- State persistence
- Multi-model comparison

## Success Metrics
- Current: 36/73 passing (49.3%)
- Target: 65/73 passing (89%)
- Critical MVP: 0/5 → Need 5/5 passing

## Next Steps
1. Fix selector issues in failing tests
2. Implement missing node connection functionality
3. Fix workflow execution pipeline
4. Address 30s timeout issues
5. Focus on MVP critical features
