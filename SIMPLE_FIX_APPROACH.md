# Simple Fix Approach - Let's Start Over

## The Real Problem
Safari blocks local JavaScript files when served over HTTP. That's it. We've been overcomplicating the solution.

## Simplest Solution
Instead of HTTPS everywhere, let's use a proper development server that Safari trusts.

## Option 1: Use Python's built-in HTTP server with proper headers
```python
# serve.py
from http.server import HTTPServer, SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
import ssl

class CORSRequestHandler(SimpleHTTPRequestHandler):
    def end_headers(self):
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', '*')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET, POST, OPTIONS')
        self.send_header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'Content-Type')
        super().end_headers()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    httpd = HTTPServer(('localhost', 3000), CORSRequestHandler)
    httpd.serve_forever()
```

## Option 2: Use a real dev server (recommended)
```bash
# Install a proper dev server
npm install -g http-server

# Run it
http-server frontend -p 3000 --cors
```

## Option 3: Use Safari's developer mode
1. Enable Developer menu in Safari
2. Disable local file restrictions
3. Run everything normally with HTTP

## Why We're Stuck
1. We're trying to solve a Safari security issue with more security (HTTPS)
2. We're creating a complex certificate chain that breaks at each step
3. We're not addressing the real issue: Safari doesn't trust Python's SimpleHTTPServer

## Recommended Action
1. Stop using HTTPS (it's not needed for local development)
2. Use a proper development server that Safari trusts
3. Keep the backend as HTTP
4. Everything will just work

The original error "Failed to load resource: An SSL error has occurred" happens because Safari doesn't trust how Python's SimpleHTTPServer serves files, NOT because we need HTTPS.
