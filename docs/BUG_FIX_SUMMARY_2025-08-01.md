# Bug Fix Summary - 2025-08-01

## Bugs Reported by User

The user reported three issues:
1. Each external model does NOT have a checkbox to use it or not
2. Ollama local models have a checkbox but it's not working
3. Ollama doesn't give the list of models and seems stuck on loading

## Investigation Findings

### BUG-011: Individual Checkboxes Issue
**Finding**: The checkboxes DO exist for each model (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Ollama) but were hard to see.

**Root Cause**: 
- Checkboxes were positioned absolutely in top-right corner
- No visual styling to make them stand out
- Small default size

**Fix Applied**:
```css
/* Make checkboxes more visible */
.form-check-input {
    width: 1.2rem;
    height: 1.2rem;
    cursor: pointer;
}

.form-check {
    background: white;
    padding: 2px;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
```

### BUG-012: Ollama Model List Not Loading
**Finding**: The Ollama status badge shows "Checking..." indefinitely

**Root Cause**:
- Poor error handling in loadOllamaModels()
- No console logging for debugging
- Unclear error messages

**Fixes Applied**:
1. Added console logging for debugging
2. Better error messages:
   - "Not Running" instead of "Offline"
   - "Connection Error" with details
3. Proper disabling of dropdown on error
4. Error details in title attribute

### BUG-013: Ollama Checkbox Not Working
**Finding**: The checkbox exists and the logic is correct

**Possible Issues**:
- The checkbox state is properly saved to localStorage
- The analyzeText function correctly checks if Ollama is enabled
- The issue might be that Ollama requires a selected model

## Current State

### What's Working:
- All models have individual checkboxes
- Checkboxes save state to localStorage
- Visual feedback when unchecked (opacity reduction)
- Ollama integration backend is correct

### What Still Needs Testing:
1. Whether Ollama service is actually running on user's machine
2. If CORS is blocking the Ollama API calls
3. If the model selection is properly synced

## How to Debug

1. **Check if Ollama is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
   ```

2. **Check browser console**:
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Look for "Loading Ollama models..." message
   - Check for any error messages

3. **Check network tab**:
   - Look for request to `/api/ollama/models`
   - Check response status and content

## Next Steps

1. User should verify Ollama is running locally
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Check if checkboxes are now visible

## Code Changes Made

1. **Enhanced checkbox visibility** - Made them larger with white background
2. **Added console logging** - For debugging Ollama loading
3. **Improved error messages** - More descriptive status badges
4. **Better error handling** - Proper try/catch with detailed errors
