# Critical Issues Roadmap - Desktop App

## Overview
This document prioritizes the critical issues found during comprehensive testing and outlines a roadmap for fixes based on impact and feasibility.

## Priority 1: CRITICAL (Fix Immediately)

### 1. DESKTOP-005: Missing Core Functionality
**Impact**: App is non-functional for end users
**Issues**:
- No actual workflow execution (mock only)
- No real API integration (all calls fail)
- No state persistence to localStorage
- No error boundaries (crashes)

**Root Cause Analysis**:
The desktop app was developed as an MVP but tests reveal it's missing fundamental features that users expect.

**Fix Strategy**:
1. **Implement Real Workflow Execution** (2-3 days)
   - Connect to actual backend API endpoints
   - Implement real topological execution
   - Add progress tracking and cancellation

2. **Add Error Boundaries** (1 day)
   - Wrap components with proper error boundaries
   - Graceful degradation on failures
   - User-friendly error messages

3. **Implement State Persistence** (1 day)
   - Proper localStorage integration
   - Auto-save functionality
   - State recovery on app restart

## Priority 2: HIGH (Fix This Week)

### 2. DESKTOP-008: React Flow Test Issues
**Impact**: Cannot properly test core functionality
**Fix**: Create comprehensive React Flow mocks or use alternative testing strategy

### 3. DESKTOP-006: API Integration Failures
**Impact**: Integration tests fail, cannot verify end-to-end functionality
**Fix**: 
- Mock API calls for tests
- Ensure backend compatibility
- Add health check endpoint

### 4. DESKTOP-007: Test Infrastructure Issues
**Impact**: Cannot verify functionality works correctly
**Fix**:
- Implement missing features that tests expect
- Add proper test timeouts
- Mock external dependencies

## Priority 3: MEDIUM (Fix Next Week)

### 5. Missing Features from Web App
Based on comparison analysis, implement:
- File upload system
- Text statistics and analysis
- Comparison engine
- Response display components
- History management

### 6. Performance and UX
- Undo/redo functionality
- Loading states and progress indicators
- Large workflow optimization
- Accessibility features

## Priority 4: LOW (Future Improvements)

### 7. Advanced Features
- Collaborative editing
- Advanced workflow templates
- Plugin system
- Advanced visualization

## Implementation Plan

### Week 1: Core Functionality (Priority 1)
**Day 1-2**: Real workflow execution
- Connect WorkflowEngine to backend
- Implement API client
- Add execution tracking

**Day 3**: Error boundaries and resilience
- Add React error boundaries
- Implement graceful failure handling
- User-friendly error messages

**Day 4**: State persistence
- localStorage integration
- Auto-save implementation
- State recovery logic

**Day 5**: Testing and validation
- Run full test suite
- Fix any regressions
- Update documentation

### Week 2: Testing Infrastructure (Priority 2)
**Day 1-2**: React Flow testing solution
- Research React Flow testing best practices
- Implement proper mocking strategy
- Fix failing component tests

**Day 3**: API integration testing
- Mock API endpoints for tests
- Add integration test suite
- Ensure backend compatibility

**Day 4-5**: Test infrastructure improvements
- Fix timeout issues
- Add proper test data setup
- Improve test reliability

### Week 3-4: Feature Parity (Priority 3)
- Implement missing web app features
- Add performance optimizations
- Improve user experience

## Success Criteria

### Week 1 Goals:
- [ ] Workflows actually execute with real backend
- [ ] App doesn't crash on errors (error boundaries)
- [ ] State persists between sessions
- [ ] Critical tests pass (>80%)

### Week 2 Goals:
- [ ] All unit tests pass reliably
- [ ] Integration tests work properly
- [ ] Test coverage >85%
- [ ] No timeout failures

### Week 3-4 Goals:
- [ ] Feature parity with web app
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] User acceptance testing passes

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items:
1. **Backend API Changes**: May need backend modifications
   - Mitigation: Document API requirements, coordinate with backend team

2. **React Flow Testing**: Complex library may be hard to mock
   - Mitigation: Research community solutions, consider E2E testing for React Flow features

3. **Performance Issues**: Large workflows may be slow
   - Mitigation: Implement progressive rendering, virtualization

### Dependencies:
- Backend API compatibility
- React Flow library limitations
- Browser API availability

## Quality Gates

Before each priority completion:
1. **All tests pass** (no exceptions)
2. **Code coverage >85%**
3. **No security vulnerabilities**
4. **Performance benchmarks met**
5. **Documentation updated**

## Bug Tracking

All fixes will be:
1. **Documented** in DESKTOP_BUGS.md
2. **Tested** with regression tests
3. **Verified** by running full test suite
4. **Reviewed** for root cause fixes (not band-aids)

## Communication

Progress will be tracked via:
- Daily todo updates
- Bug database updates
- Test result monitoring
- User feedback integration

This roadmap ensures we fix the most critical issues first while maintaining quality standards and proper testing practices.
