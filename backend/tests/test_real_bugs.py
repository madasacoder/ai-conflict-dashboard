ACTUAL BUGS/VULNERABILITIES FOUND:

1. DESIGN BUG: Circuit breakers are global
   - One user's bad API key affects ALL users
   - Should be per-key or per-user

2. SECURITY BUG: CORS allows all origins  
   - Any website can use the API
   - Should whitelist origins

3. SECURITY BUG: No rate limiting
   - Easy to DOS the service
   - Easy to exhaust API quotas

4. BUG: Chunking can split code blocks
   - Breaks syntax highlighting
   - Makes code unreadable

5. BUG: Token counting wrong for unicode
   - Emojis counted as 1/4 token
   - Will exceed API limits

6. POTENTIAL XSS: Frontend innerHTML usage
   - Even with escaping, risky
   - Should use textContent where possible

7. POTENTIAL: Memory leaks with large responses
   - Need profiling to confirm

8. UX BUG: Duplicate filenames confusing
   - File badges can have same name
   - No way to distinguish

9. PRIVACY: API keys might be logged
   - Need audit of all logging
   - Keys in text content risky

10. MISSING: Request timeout handling
    - What if API never responds?
    - Could hang indefinitely
