## Quality Check Results

**Important Finding**: During our quality check session, we did NOT fix any desktop app issues. We focused entirely on:
- Web app JavaScript tests (reduced failures from 27 to 6)
- Web app Python tests (reduced failures from 17 to 16)
- Fixed security bug in escapeHtml function
- Applied code formatting and linting

The desktop app was not touched during quality improvements.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)
1. **Migrate Critical Tests**
   - API integration tests
   - Ollama tests  
   - Regression test suite

2. **Add Missing Features**
   - File upload system
   - Text statistics
   - Comparison engine

### Medium Priority
3. **Enhance Testing**
   - Add E2E workflow tests
   - Add performance tests
   - Increase coverage to 80%+

4. **Feature Additions**
   - Response display
   - History management
   - Direct text input mode

### Low Priority
5. **UI Improvements**
   - Dark mode
   - Better styling
   - Keyboard shortcuts

## Effort Estimate

- **Test Migration**: 1 week
- **Critical Features**: 2 weeks  
- **Full Feature Parity**: 4 weeks total
- **Team Size**: 1-2 developers

## Conclusion

The desktop app has superior architecture but lacks many user-facing features that make the web app immediately useful. By migrating tests and adding missing features, the desktop app could become the definitive version of the AI Conflict Dashboard, combining the best of both implementations.
