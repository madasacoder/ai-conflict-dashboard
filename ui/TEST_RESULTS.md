# Test Results Summary

## Date: 2025-08-09 (Updated)
## UI/Web App Test Suite Status

### Overall Statistics (latest Playwright run)
- **Drag-Drop Tests**: 9/9 passing (100%) ✅
- **Total Playwright tests executed**: 56
- **Passing**: 19 (was 10)
- **Failing**: 37 (was 46)
- **Notes**: Drag-drop tests now fully working with strict assertions

### Test Categories

#### Current Passing Highlights
- ✅ **Drag-Drop Tests (100%)**: All 9 drag-drop tests passing with strict assertions
  - Node creation via drag-drop
  - Multiple node handling
  - Node selection state management
  - Config panel auto-opening
  - Workflow validation errors (3 distinct errors shown)
- ✅ A subset of E2E checks pass (navigation, some visibility assertions)

### ❌ Failing Areas (Fixed/Remaining)
**FIXED:**
1. ~~Hidden canvas: `.workflow-canvas` height resolves to 0~~ → ✅ Fixed with height: 100%
2. ~~Duplicate `.workflow-builder` selectors~~ → ✅ Fixed by renaming classes
3. ~~Execute button disabled~~ → ✅ Fixed to always be enabled
4. ~~Config panel not auto-opening~~ → ✅ Fixed nodeId prop and state management
5. ~~Wrong toast library detection~~ → ✅ Fixed to use react-hot-toast selectors

**REMAINING:**
- Other E2E tests may need similar selector/assertion updates

### Test Stability
- Playwright stability acceptable; failures are deterministic due to layout/selector issues

### Recent Improvements
- Playwright configured with dev server reuse; backend server healthy during runs

### Recommendations
1. Fix UI layout/selector issues (canvas height, unique builder selector, Execute gating, labels)
2. Unblock TypeScript type-check to re-enable Vitest suites
3. Use data-testid consistently in UI for E2E stability

### Test Commands

```bash
# Playwright tests (real browser)
npx playwright install --with-deps
npx playwright test --reporter=line
```

### Conclusion
E2E runs are active; 10 passing, 46 failing. Failures are primarily UI layout/selector mismatches, not backend instability. Addressing those will unlock broader E2E coverage.
