# Desktop App Transformation Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of transforming the AI Conflict Dashboard from a web application to a desktop application using Tauri, as outlined in `bigNextstep.md`.

**Transformation Start Date**: 2025-08-01  
**Target Completion**: 7 weeks (by 2025-09-19)  
**Current Phase**: Sprint 1 - Core Foundation (Week 1-2)  
**Progress**: 2/5 tasks completed (40%)

## Project Goals
- Transform from web app to native desktop application using Tauri
- Add visual workflow builder with React Flow
- Implement local-first architecture with SQLite
- Enable offline capability with Ollama fallback
- Create beautiful, intuitive GUI that delights users

## Current Status

### Active Task: Task 1.3 - Beautiful Workflow Builder UI
**Status**: Ready to begin

### Completed Tasks

#### ✅ Task 1.2: Simple SQLite Schema (Completed 2025-08-02)
- Created user-focused SQLite schema with 7 tables
- Implemented SQLAlchemy models with helper methods
- Built database utilities for backup/restore (< 100ms operations)
- Added seed data with 4 example workflows
- Created comprehensive test suite (all passing)
- Integrated database with desktop API endpoints

#### ✅ Task 1.1: Simple Project Setup with Enhanced DX (Completed 2025-08-01)
- Created complete project structure in `desktop-app/` directory
- Set up React + Vite + Tauri configuration
- Created FastAPI backend with basic endpoints
- Added testing frameworks (Vitest + Pytest)
- Created startup scripts for all platforms
- Added comprehensive documentation

### Migration Considerations
1. **Current Web App Status**:
   - Phase 2 partially complete with significant implementation gaps
   - 81% backend test coverage (56 failing tests)
   - 3 AI providers integrated (OpenAI, Claude, Ollama) - Gemini and Grok are mock implementations
   - Security implementation has vulnerabilities
   - Comprehensive logging and monitoring

2. **Features to Migrate**:
   - Multi-model orchestration
   - Consensus/conflict analysis
   - Cost tracking
   - File upload and processing
   - API key management
   - Model selection UI

3. **New Features in Desktop App**:
   - Visual workflow builder (React Flow)
   - Local SQLite storage
   - Offline capability with Ollama
   - Native OS integration
   - Auto-updates
   - Signed distribution

## Technical Stack Changes

### From (Current Web App):
- Frontend: Vanilla JavaScript + Bootstrap 5
- Backend: FastAPI (Python)
- Storage: localStorage + IndexedDB
- Deployment: Web-based

### To (Desktop App):
- Frontend: React + React Flow + Zustand
- Backend: FastAPI (integrated with Tauri)
- Storage: SQLite (local-first)
- Framework: Tauri (Rust + WebView)
- Deployment: Native installers (signed)

## Key Decisions Made
1. Using Tauri instead of Electron for smaller size (<30MB vs 100MB+)
2. React for better component architecture and React Flow integration
3. Zustand for state management (simpler than Redux)
4. SQLite for local-first data persistence
5. Maintaining FastAPI backend for API compatibility

## Risks & Mitigation
1. **Risk**: Learning curve for Tauri/React if not familiar
   - **Mitigation**: Start with simple setup task (1.1) to validate stack

2. **Risk**: Code signing certificates expensive/complex
   - **Mitigation**: Task 1.6 addresses this early to avoid distribution issues

3. **Risk**: Migration of existing features takes longer than expected
   - **Mitigation**: Core features only in MVP, enhance iteratively

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Week 3 Checkpoint: User can create and run a workflow
- [ ] Week 5 Checkpoint: Analysis provides clear insights
- [ ] Week 7 Checkpoint: App installs without warnings, <2s startup

## Next Steps
1. Decide whether to start with Task 1.6 (signing pipeline) or Task 1.1 (project setup)
2. Create new project structure for Tauri app
3. Set up development environment with proper tooling
4. Begin implementation following the detailed prompts in bigNextstep.md
