# AI Conflict Dashboard - Frontend

A React-based frontend for the AI Conflict Dashboard with testing in development.

## ðŸš§ Test Suite Status (latest local run)

- Type-check (strict): failing with numerous errors across services/state/tests
- Vitest: blocked by type errors and strict constraints
- Playwright: tests start but fail early (cannot find "Launch Workflow Builder" button)
- Integration with backend requires live API or MSW alignment

### Running Tests (May Have Issues)
```bash
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
npm run type-check
npm test -- --run
npx playwright install
npx playwright test --reporter=line
```

### Frontend Bugs Being Addressed
- **BUG-081**: Desktop App Missing React Flow Instance ðŸš§ (test exists, needs verification)
- **BUG-082**: Drag and Drop Completely Broken ðŸš§ (test exists, needs verification)

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface using React Flow
- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of AI model responses
- **Real-time Execution**: Live monitoring of workflow execution
- **Result Visualization**: Syntax highlighting and structured display
- **State Management**: Centralized state with Zustand

### Security & Reliability
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling and recovery
- **XSS Protection**: DOMPurify integration for safe content rendering
- **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup and memory leak detection

### Testing & Quality (In Development)
- **Regression Tests**: Test suite in progress
- **Unit Tests**: Some component-level testing with React Testing Library
- **Integration Tests**: Basic component interaction testing
- **E2E Tests**: Some user scenario testing with Playwright
- **Goal**: Working towards comprehensive test coverage

## Technology Stack

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks and concurrent features
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and better developer experience
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server
- **React Flow**: Visual workflow builder
- **Zustand**: Lightweight state management
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **Playwright**: E2E testing framework

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
