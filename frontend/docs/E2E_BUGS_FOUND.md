## Bug #001: Node Stacking Issue

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Workflow Builder UI

### Description

When creating multiple nodes in the workflow builder, all nodes were stacking on top of each other at coordinates (0,0) instead of being properly positioned.

### Root Cause

The workflow automation framework was not positioning nodes after creation. Nodes were created at their default position.

### Fix Applied

Added node positioning logic to `WorkflowTestFramework`:

- Added `nodePositions` and `nodeSpacing` properties
- Created `positionNode()` method to drag nodes to specific coordinates
- Created `getNextNodePosition()` to calculate proper spacing
- Modified all `create*Node()` methods to position nodes after creation

### Verification

Nodes now properly space out horizontally with 300px spacing.

## Bug #002: Config Panel Blocking Node Interactions

**Status**: üîß IN PROGRESS  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Workflow Builder UI / Config Panel

### Description

The configuration panel remains open after configuring a node and blocks subsequent node clicks. The panel intercepts pointer events preventing interaction with nodes behind it.

### Symptoms

- `TimeoutError: locator.click: Timeout 5000ms exceeded`
- Error: `<div id="configContent">...</div> from <div id="configPanel" class="config-panel open">...</div> subtree intercepts pointer events`

### Root Cause

1. The config panel close button selector was incorrect
2. The panel uses CSS animations that take time to complete
3. The panel remains in the DOM and blocks interactions even when "closed"

### Attempted Fixes

1. ‚ùå Used various selectors for close button
2. ‚ùå Clicked outside to close panel
3. ‚úÖ Used `page.evaluate()` to remove 'open' class directly
4. üîß Still investigating timing issues with panel animations

### Current Status

Panel closes but timing issues remain. Need to add proper wait conditions.

## Bug #003: Model Selection for Ollama

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è WORKAROUND  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: LLM Configuration

### Description

The workflow builder UI doesn't have a specific checkbox for Ollama models. The UI only shows commercial model options (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini).

### Impact

Cannot directly select Ollama models through the UI when creating LLM nodes.

### Workaround

1. Leave all model checkboxes unchecked
2. Include model directive in prompt: `[OLLAMA:gemma3:4b]`
3. Backend should route to Ollama when no commercial models selected

### Proper Fix Needed

Add Ollama checkbox option to the workflow builder UI model selection.

## Bug #004: Navigation Away from Workflow Builder

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Config Panel Close Button

### Description

Clicking the config panel close button sometimes navigated away from workflow-builder.html to index.html.

### Root Cause

Initial close button implementation was triggering unintended navigation or form submission.

### Fix Applied

Used `page.evaluate()` to directly manipulate DOM and remove 'open' class, matching the application's `closeConfig()` implementation.

---

## Bug #005: Connection Drag-and-Drop Issues

**Status**: üîç INVESTIGATING  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Node Connections

### Description

Cannot reliably create connections between nodes using drag-and-drop in the automated tests.

### Symptoms

- Connections fail to create even with proper mouse movements
- No visual feedback during connection attempts
- `connectNodes()` method executes but connections don't appear

### Investigation Needed

1. Identify the exact connection point elements (yellow/orange circles)
2. Verify mouse event requirements (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup)
3. Check if there are specific CSS classes or attributes needed

---

## Bug #006: Ollama Integration in Workflow Execution

**Status**: üîç INVESTIGATING  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Workflow Execution

### Description

When clicking "Run" button, the workflow doesn't execute with Ollama models despite proper configuration.

### Expected Behavior

1. Workflow should send requests to Ollama at localhost:11434
2. Nodes should show processing state
3. Results should appear in node outputs

### Current Behavior

- Run button clicks successfully
- No visible execution progress
- No Ollama API calls observed

### Investigation Needed

1. Check browser console for errors
2. Monitor network tab for API calls
3. Verify backend Ollama integration in workflow context

---

## Bug #007: Wrong Port Configuration

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Playwright Configuration

### Description

E2E tests were configured to use port 8080 but the application runs on port 3000.

### Symptoms

- Tests failed to connect to application
- `Error: page.goto: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`

### Root Cause

Incorrect port configuration in playwright.config.js.

### Fix Applied

Updated playwright.config.js:

- Changed baseURL from 8080 to 3000
- Updated webServer port configuration

---

## Bug #008: Incorrect UI Element Selectors

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Node Creation UI

### Description

Node creation was failing because selectors were targeting the wrong elements. The correct elements use `div[data-node-type="..."].node-item` pattern.

### Root Cause

Initial implementation used generic selectors that matched unintended elements.

### Fix Applied

Updated all node creation selectors:

- Input: `div[data-node-type="input"].node-item`
- LLM: `div[data-node-type="llm"].node-item`
- Compare: `div[data-node-type="compare"].node-item`
- Output: `div[data-node-type="output"].node-item`

## Bug #009: Config Panel Animation Timing

**Status**: üîß IN PROGRESS  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: Config Panel

### Description

Config panel uses CSS animations that create timing issues. Even after removing the 'open' class, the panel may still be animating and blocking interactions.

### Impact

- Intermittent test failures
- Race conditions when configuring multiple nodes quickly

### Current Mitigation

Added 300ms wait after closing panel to allow animation completion.

### Proper Fix Needed

Wait for animation end event or use more robust visibility checks.

---

## Bug #010: Missing Ollama Model in Prompt

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: Ollama Integration

### Description

Initial Ollama prompts didn't include the model directive, causing backend routing issues.

### Fix Applied

Added `[OLLAMA:gemma3:4b]` prefix to all Ollama prompts to ensure proper model routing.

---

## Bug #011: Config Panel Not Closing Between Nodes

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Test Framework

### Description

Config panel remained open after configuring a node, preventing subsequent node interactions.

### Root Cause

Missing panel close logic in node creation methods.

### Fix Applied

Added `closeConfigPanel()` method that uses `page.evaluate()` to directly manipulate DOM.

---

## Bug #012: Workflow Execution Not Triggering

**Status**: üîç INVESTIGATING  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Workflow Execution

### Description

Clicking the Run button doesn't trigger actual Ollama API calls or show execution progress.

### Investigation Needed

1. Verify backend WebSocket connections
2. Check if nodes are properly connected in the workflow data model
3. Monitor browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify Ollama endpoint configuration

---

## Bug #013: Node Connection Visual Feedback Missing

**Status**: üîç INVESTIGATING  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: UI Feedback

### Description

No visual indication when attempting to create connections between nodes during automated tests.

### Expected Behavior

- Connection line should appear during drag
- Nodes should highlight when hovering over connection points
- Success/failure feedback after connection attempt

### Impact

Difficult to debug why connections aren't being created.

---

## Bug #014: Test Framework Memory Leaks

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è MONITORING  
**Severity**: Low  
**Component**: Test Framework

### Description

Long-running tests may accumulate memory due to DOM references and event listeners not being properly cleaned up.

### Mitigation

- Added `destroy()` method to clear references
- Implemented proper cleanup in afterEach hooks

### Monitoring Needed

Track memory usage during extended test runs.

## Summary Statistics

- **Total Bugs Found**: 14
- **Fixed**: 7
- **In Progress**: 2
- **Workaround Applied**: 1
- **Investigating**: 3
- **Monitoring**: 1

## Lessons Learned

1. **Visual Testing is Critical**: Many issues only became apparent when running tests with `--headed` flag
2. **DOM Timing Matters**: CSS animations and transitions can cause automation timing issues
3. **Selector Specificity**: Generic selectors often match unintended elements
4. **Model Integration**: UI doesn't always support all backend capabilities (Ollama case)
5. **Port Configuration**: Always verify application port matches test configuration
6. **Connection Mechanics**: Drag-and-drop operations require precise element targeting
7. **Animation Awareness**: UI animations can block automated interactions
8. **Cleanup Importance**: Proper test cleanup prevents memory leaks and flaky tests

## Bug #015: Workflow Executor Missing Ollama Support

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Backend Workflow Executor

### Description

The workflow executor didn't have Ollama in its model mapping, causing Ollama workflows to fail execution.

### Root Cause

1. `workflow_executor.py` was missing "ollama" in the model_mapping dictionary
2. No special handling for Ollama (which doesn't require an API key)

### Fix Applied

1. Added "ollama" to model_mapping in workflow_executor.py
2. Added special case handling for Ollama with empty API key
3. Updated test framework to properly select Ollama checkbox

### Verification

Ollama workflows now execute properly through the backend.

## Bug #016: Workflow Execution API Not Being Called

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Frontend Workflow Execution

### Description

The Run button click doesn't seem to trigger the workflow execution API call to the backend.

### Symptoms

- No `/api/workflows/execute` calls in recent backend logs
- No execution feedback in UI
- No error messages displayed

### Investigation Added

1. Added console logging to `runWorkflow()` method
2. Added logging for API request/response
3. Need to check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Root Cause

Frontend was trying to call `/api/workflows/execute` on the frontend server (port 3000) instead of the backend server (port 8000).

### Fix Applied

Changed the fetch URL from `/api/workflows/execute` to `http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/execute`

---

## Bug #017: Wrong API Endpoint Port

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Frontend API Calls

### Description

Workflow execution was failing with 501 error because the frontend was calling the API on port 3000 instead of 8000.

### Symptoms

- 501 "Unsupported method ('POST')" error
- API calls going to frontend server instead of backend

### Fix Applied

Updated workflow-builder.js to use full backend URL: `http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/execute`

---

## Bug #018: CORS Error on Workflow Execution

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Backend CORS Configuration

### Description

Workflow execution fails due to CORS policy blocking the request from frontend (port 3000) to backend (port 8000).

### Error Message

"Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:8000/api/workflows/execute' from origin 'http://localhost:3000' has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource."

### Root Cause

The CORS middleware wasn't allowing OPTIONS method, which is needed for preflight requests.

### Fix Applied

Added "OPTIONS" to the allowed methods in the CORS middleware configuration in main.py.

---

## Bug #019: GPT-4 Checkbox Checked by Default

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: Medium  
**Component**: Workflow Builder UI

### Description

When creating new LLM nodes, GPT-4 checkbox was checked by default in the inline node display, even though the test was selecting Ollama.

### Root Cause

The `getNodeContentHTML` method had hardcoded `checked` attribute on the GPT-4 checkbox.

### Fix Applied

Removed the `checked` attribute from the GPT-4 checkbox in the inline HTML generation.

---

## Bug #020: No Visual Output Display After Workflow Execution

**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Severity**: High  
**Component**: Workflow Builder Results Display

### Description

After workflow execution completes successfully, results were only shown via alert() and console.log. No visual feedback was provided in the UI, and users couldn't see the actual LLM output.

### Root Cause

The `showResults()` method only displayed an alert message instead of properly showing the execution results in the UI.

### Fix Applied

1. Enhanced `showResults()` to:
   - Display results in a Bootstrap modal
   - Add visual feedback on nodes (success/error states)
   - Show output preview directly on LLM nodes

2. Added new methods:
   - `showResultsModal()` - Creates and displays results modal
   - `formatResultsHtml()` - Formats results for display

3. Added CSS styles for:
   - `.execution-success` - Green border for successful nodes
   - `.execution-error` - Red border for failed nodes  
   - `.node-output-preview` - Preview box on nodes

4. Output preview shows first 200 characters of LLM response directly on the node.

### Test Results

Created mock data test that validates:
- Modal displays correctly ‚úÖ
- Chinese text renders properly ‚úÖ
- Visual states update ‚úÖ
- Output previews appear ‚úÖ
- Error handling works ‚úÖ
