# E2E Test Migration Status

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of migrating E2E tests from the web app to the desktop app, with E2E tests as the top priority per user request.

## Completed Migrations âœ…

### 1. Test Infrastructure
- **Playwright with React support**: Installed and configured
- **DesktopWorkflowFramework**: Created helper class for test automation
- **Test-ids**: Added to all critical components
- **Custom controls**: Created with test-ids for zoom operations
- **Node configuration modal**: Built from scratch with full test support

### 2. Core E2E Tests

#### WorkflowComprehensive.test.tsx âœ…
**Original**: `frontend/e2e/workflow-builder-comprehensive.spec.js`
**Status**: Fully migrated with desktop-specific adaptations
**Coverage**:
- Workflow builder loading and components
- Node creation via palette
- Node connections with React Flow
- Node configuration via modal
- Workflow save/load from database
- Import/export functionality
- Validation and error handling
- API key configuration
- Keyboard shortcuts
- XSS prevention
- Large workflow performance
- Accessibility standards
- Dark mode support

#### TranslationPipeline.test.tsx âœ…
**Original**: `frontend/e2e/execute-translation-pipeline.spec.js`  
**Status**: Fully migrated with enhanced features
**Coverage**:
- Multi-step translation pipeline (English â†’ Chinese â†’ French â†’ English)
- Node positioning and connections
- Workflow execution with progress tracking
- Result extraction and display
- Error handling in pipeline
- Ollama support for local translation
- Screenshot capture

#### OllamaIntegration.test.tsx âœ…
**Original**: `frontend/e2e/workflow-builder-ollama.spec.js`
**Status**: Fully migrated with desktop adaptations
**Coverage**:
- Ollama model selection UI
- Service availability handling
- Workflow execution with local models
- Configuration persistence
- Cloud/local model switching
- UI feedback during processing

## Pending Migrations ðŸ”„

### High Priority E2E Tests (Week 1)
1. **basic-workflow-execution.spec.js** - Basic workflow operations
2. **workflow-node-manipulation.spec.js** - Node CRUD operations
3. **story-translation-pipeline.spec.js** - Story-specific translation
4. **simple-chinese-translation.spec.js** - Simple translation flow
5. **verify-output-display.spec.js** - Output visualization
6. **test-connection-feedback.spec.js** - Connection visual feedback
7. **regression-all-bugs.spec.js** - 20+ bug regression tests

### Medium Priority (Week 2)
- API integration tests
- Component integration tests
- Workflow templates tests

## Key Differences Handled

### 1. **Component Architecture**
- Web: Drawflow with vanilla JS
- Desktop: React Flow with TypeScript

### 2. **Node Interaction**
- Web: Direct DOM manipulation
- Desktop: React component methods

### 3. **State Management**
- Web: Global window objects
- Desktop: Zustand store

### 4. **Testing Approach**
- Web: Page navigation and selectors
- Desktop: Component mounting with CT

## Next Steps

1. **Run migrated tests** to identify any runtime issues
2. **Continue migration** of remaining high-priority E2E tests
3. **Add missing features** identified during testing:
   - File upload system
   - Text statistics
   - Comparison engine
   - Response display panel
   - History management

## Test Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run specific test file
npm run test:e2e WorkflowComprehensive.test.tsx

# Run with UI mode for debugging
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run with debug mode
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

## Success Metrics
- âœ… 3/29 E2E tests migrated (10%)
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: 100% E2E test migration
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: 80%+ test coverage
- ðŸŽ¯ Target: All regression bugs covered

## Notes
- All migrated tests include console logging for debugging
- Screenshots are saved to `test-results/` directory
- Tests are designed to work both with and without backend
- Mock responses are provided for offline testing
