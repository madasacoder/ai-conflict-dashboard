   - Exponential backoff for retries

2. **BUG-047: Node Creation Race Conditions** ✅
   - Implemented NodeCreationQueue in workflowStore
   - Queue-based processing with 50ms delays
   - Prevents state corruption

3. **BUG-048: Input Sanitization** ✅
   - Enhanced sanitize.ts with comprehensive escaping
   - Context-aware sanitization (HTML, SQL, Regex, URL)
   - Directory traversal prevention

4. **BUG-049: Edge Deletion** ✅
   - Added keyboard shortcuts (Delete/Backspace)

- Retry with exponential backoff
- Batch requests with concurrency control
- Network speed monitoring

## Test Results

### E2E Tests
```bash
✅ 9/9 drag-drop tests passing (100%)
