## üìù Technical Implementation Notes

### Comparison Algorithm
- Simple but effective word-based similarity calculation
- Identifies structural differences (length, punctuation usage)
- Provides actionable insights about differences

### Storage Strategy
- localStorage for all persistence (history, theme, API keys)
- History limited to 20 items to prevent storage issues
- Automatic cleanup of old items

### UI Enhancements
- Bootstrap Icons for better visual appeal
- Responsive design maintained
- All new features integrate cleanly with Phase 0 design

## üöÄ What's Next?

### Immediate Usage Validation
1. Test with real documents and use cases
2. Gather feedback on comparison accuracy
3. Identify any UI/UX pain points
4. Validate if history limit (20) is sufficient

### Potential Phase 0.2 Enhancements
Based on usage, consider:
- More sophisticated diff algorithm (line-by-line)
- Export functionality for comparisons
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Improved file handling for larger files
- Search within history

## üìä Metrics to Track
- How often is comparison view used?
- Average number of history items accessed
- File upload usage vs manual text entry
- Dark mode adoption rate
- Copy button usage frequency

## üéØ Success Criteria Met
‚úÖ Can compare responses and see differences
‚úÖ Can access previous comparisons
‚úÖ Can upload text files for analysis
‚úÖ Can copy responses easily
‚úÖ Can use in dark mode for extended sessions
