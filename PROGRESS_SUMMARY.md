# Progress Summary - AI Conflict Dashboard

## Session Summary (2025-08-02)

### Starting State
- User frustrated with 12+ hours of no progress
- Drag-and-drop not working in desktop app
- Workflow builder giving errors in web app
- Ollama integration showing generic "error" message
- Test coverage falsely claimed as 92% (actual: 31%)
- 65 tests failing, test infrastructure broken

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. Fixed Workflow Builder (BUG-027) âœ…
- **Problem**: Workflow builder page showed blank error
- **Root Cause**: JavaScript errors during Drawflow initialization
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `workflow-builder-fixed.js` with comprehensive error handling
  - Added proper error messages when libraries fail to load
  - Fixed backend URL for workflow execution (was relative `/api/`, now absolute `http://localhost:8000/api/`)
  - Added debugging and logging throughout
- **Status**: FIXED - Workflow builder now loads without errors

#### 2. Created Pragmatic Recovery Plan
- Acknowledged real state (31% coverage, not 92%)
- Created `smallsteps-pragmatic.md` with realistic 3-week plan
- Updated `BUGS.md` with 4 new bugs (BUG-027 through BUG-030)
- Created `DAILY_STATUS.md` for tracking progress
- Created `TODO_PRIORITY.md` with prioritized tasks

#### 3. Infrastructure Improvements
- Started backend server successfully with uvicorn
- Installed missing dependency (psutil)
- Created multiple test pages for debugging:
  - `workflow-debug.html` - Step-by-step Drawflow testing
  - `test-drawflow.html` - CDN loading verification
  - `workflow-test-simple.html` - Comprehensive workflow testing
  - `test-ollama.html` - Ollama integration debugging

#### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated BUGS.md with accurate status
- Created honest daily status tracking
- Documented all fixes and workarounds

### Current State
- **Backend**: Running on port 8000 âœ…
- **Frontend**: Running on port 3000 âœ…
- **Workflow Builder**: Fixed and functional âœ…
- **Ollama Integration**: Backend works, frontend issue identified ðŸŸ¡
- **Test Infrastructure**: Still broken, needs fixing ðŸ”´

### Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Complete Ollama Fix (BUG-028)** - 2 hours
   - Frontend shows "error" despite backend working
   - Need to debug exact error in production environment
   
2. **Fix Test Infrastructure (BUG-029)** - 3 hours
   - Fix missing 'client' fixture in pytest
   - Get accurate coverage report
   - Create TEST_STATUS.md

3. **Consolidate Workflow Builders (BUG-030)** - 6 hours
   - Three implementations exist
   - Choose the most stable
   - Delete duplicates

### Key Learnings
1. **Don't trust documentation** - Claimed 92% coverage was actually 31%
2. **Test in production environment** - Many issues only appear with real setup
3. **Add comprehensive logging** - Essential for debugging user-reported issues
4. **Be honest about state** - No more false claims or vaporware

### Success Metrics This Session
- Fixed 1 HIGH severity bug (BUG-027)
- Created realistic recovery plan
- Established daily tracking system
- Backend and frontend both running
- 76.7% of all bugs now fixed (23/30)

### User Quote
> "I want a very very solid app. a WORKING APP that is bug free. i do not want vaporware"

We're on track to deliver this by following the pragmatic plan and fixing real issues.
