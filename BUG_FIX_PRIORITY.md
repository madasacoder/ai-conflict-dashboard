**Fix**: Add SSL error documentation
**Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

### ðŸŸ¢ BUG-079: Test File Naming Convention
**Impact**: Cosmetic issue
**Fix**: Rename test files
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes

### ðŸŸ¢ BUG-080: Frontend Logger Test Expectation
**Impact**: Test failure only
**Fix**: Update test expectation
**Estimated Time**: 5 minutes

## Quick Wins (Can Fix Now)

These bugs can be fixed in under 10 minutes each:

1. **BUG-071**: Change mock assertion method (5 min)
2. **BUG-080**: Update test expectation string (5 min)
3. **BUG-079**: Rename test files (15 min)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Common Patterns Found:
1. **Missing Integration**: Desktop app not properly integrated with React Flow
2. **Test Environment Issues**: Tests expect different environment than provided
3. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple components don't handle concurrent access properly
4. **Protocol Confusion**: HTTP/HTTPS handling inconsistent across components
5. **Incomplete Implementation**: Many features have tests but no implementation

### Systemic Issues:
1. Desktop app appears to be in very early stage (10% complete per previous analysis)
2. Tests were written before implementation (TDD gone wrong)
3. Missing integration between frontend and backend components
4. Inadequate error handling throughout the application

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Make App Functional (1-2 days)
1. Fix BUG-081 (React Flow initialization)
2. Fix BUG-082 (Drag and drop)
3. Fix BUG-084 (App rendering)

### Phase 2: Stabilize Core Features (2-3 days)
1. Fix BUG-075 (Circuit breaker)
2. Fix BUG-078 (Event handlers)
3. Fix BUG-072 (Concurrent failures)

### Phase 3: Polish and Complete (3-4 days)
1. Fix all medium priority bugs
2. Configure E2E tests properly
3. Add missing documentation

### Phase 4: Cleanup (1 day)
1. Fix all low priority bugs
2. Ensure all tests pass
3. Update documentation

## Success Metrics

After fixing these bugs:
- âœ… Desktop app should be functional with drag-and-drop
- âœ… Circuit breaker should protect against failures
- âœ… All critical paths should have working tests
- âœ… Test success rate should increase from ~60% to >95%
- âœ… Application should handle edge cases gracefully

## Notes

- Focus on critical bugs first as they block all other functionality
- Many test failures are cascading from the critical bugs
- Once BUG-081 and BUG-082 are fixed, many other tests may start passing
- Consider implementing features incrementally with tests
